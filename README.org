#+title: Readme

This Repo contains my solutions from the C-piscine in Wolfsburg July2024.
The piscine is a 26-day program consisting of
- 14 pdf's of exercises on the C programming language
- 2 pdf's of exercises on shell and linux operating system
- 3 2-day projects, called rushes and
- 4 exams, where each exam takes 4 hours, except the last which takes 8 hours

The school is open 24/7 for the participants, and they are there on their behalf.
There are no teachers, nor alumnis which help with the exercises. One needs to rely
on its own skills
- to educate one-self
- to ask for help (your peers)
- to listen and try to understand
- to be honest and humble with regards to what you know
- to work together with your peers
- to manage your time and energy on your own
